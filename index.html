			we are an inspired group of people with different backgrounds and	backstories, aiming to join hands and cooperate in our mission to	learn, trying to channel peer pressure into something positive instead of plain old envy, you think you know something? I dare you to explain	it to me!.

		<h2>Our Motto</h2>

	</div>

	<div class="manifesto_text long_description">
		<p>
			In a world of perpetually changing variables, the only constant is	change. Always be in a state of motion, or perish in the sea of	mediocrity where no pirate ever survived. This liquid, forever changing nature of the world implies that freedom is in the opposite	of assuming still forms, that is, in not taking strictly defined shapes that can be shaken and broken by time.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Don't be a constant, be a variables</p>

				You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in	a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend

		<p>ethics are a priority, an ignorant kind person is always favored over a genius rude one</p>
		<p>the hierarchy is mostly a representational thing, it shouldn’t meddle with the logistics nor discourage
			participation</p>
		<p>non-exclusivity, and cooperation are key</p>
		<p>the (symbolic and ridiculously limited authority) is not to be exploited for personal gain, especially in a
			way that sabotages the overall club progress, or someone else’s progress, in any way, shape or form</p>
		<p>Seniority, and experience are far more important than mere labels(president, vice, cow-owner …etc)</p>
		<p>Seniors are to be treated with respect à la Japanese traditions</p>
